    "# The pySIP library\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters on this series showed the theory behind linear stochastic state-space models. The theory was then applied by calibrating a simple 2R2C model on the heat dynamics of an unoccupied test house. The purpose was to give a transparent overview of the mechanics of state-space models and the Kalman filter. In practical applications however, we will wish to ensure that we obtained a robust predictive model, suitable for building energy performance assessment and prediction of energy use. Additional tools are required to assist in model selection, diagnostics of convergence, validation of calibrated models, and eventually Bayesian inference. This is why [the pySIP python library for stochastic state-space inference and prediction](https://github.com/locie/pySIP) was developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "pySIP provides a framework for infering continuous time linear stochastic state-space models. For that purpose, it is possible to chose between a frequentist and a Bayesian workflow. Each workflow allows to estimate the parameters, assess the inference and model reliability, and perform model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page is an example of how pySIP can be used, with the same data and model structure as the previous notebook on state-space models. The following code is provided as an example in the pySIP repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are considering the same experimental building, and the same measurement period, as in the [previous notebook](statespace_simple).\n",

    "The building is monitored by a variety of sensors, but the present study only uses records of indoor temperature and prescribed heating power, in addition to weather data. The indoor temperature profiles used here have been averaged over several sensors distributed in the living space. An experimental sequence of four days was used in this study.\n",
