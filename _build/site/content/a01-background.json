The gap in energy performance between older, poorly insulated constructions, and newer net-zero energy or passive buildings with efficient energy control strategies, shows the magnitude of the improvement that could be brought to the energy efficiency of the building stock. It is commonly known that the share of new buildings in the overall construction sector is very low. Most buildings are several decades old and often have poor energy performance, especially compared to recent standards for new constructions. The largest potential for energy savings in the building sector therefore lies in the renovation of the existing building stock, or its proper energy management.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"JKHkmxfg42"}],"key":"ssEG8YQRnU"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Data science offers promising prospects for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Thanks to the availability of smart meters and sensor networks, along with increasingly accessible algorithms for data processing and analysis, statistical models may be trained to predict the energy use of HVAC systems or the indoor conditions. These trained models and their predictions then lead to various inferences: assessing the real impact of energy conservation measures; identifying HVAC faults or physical properties of the envelope in order to provide incentive for retrofitting; minimizing energy consumption through model\tpredictive control; detecting and diagnosing faults; etc.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"uBMNNXhTf0"}],"key":"LgiuzoDqoQ"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The availability of measurements and computational power have given data mining methods an increasing popularity. The field of data analysis applied to building energy performance assessment however faces two main challenges to this day. Ironically, the first challenge is the abundance of data. Smart meters and building management systems deliver large amounts of information which can hide the few readings which are the most relevant to energy conservation. Automated monitoring and fault detection algorithms only do what they are told, and will hardly replace human intervention when it comes to understanding readings. The second challenge is the difficulty of data science. Without a principled methodology, it is very easy to draw erroneous conclusions, by incorrectly assuming that a model is properly trained. By lack of a background in statistics, building energy practitioners often lack the tools to ensure their inferences are correct.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"eycO5wUhOR"}],"key":"z2sxZ8Wtmh"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From data to energy savings","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"key":"qgUlgJklFR"}],"identifier":"from-data-to-energy-savings","label":"From data to energy savings","html_id":"from-data-to-energy-savings","implicit":true,"key":"dYYFZys31R"},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Formalisation of the system","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"key":"gnYZaJi5uB"}],"identifier":"formalisation-of-the-system","label":"Formalisation of the system","html_id":"formalisation-of-the-system","implicit":true,"key":"mvHJQTiZut"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Before proposing a few examples on how data acquisition may support energy conservation measures, let us first formalise the framework, in which the following parts of this book will describe building energy performance.","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"CaMbIEaUiw"}],"key":"ViEtTnOzMp"}],"key":"BbIOeAI5b7"}],"key":"Ymil5hLhNn"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
