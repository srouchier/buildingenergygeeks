# Simplified building energy modelling

**Note**: this chapter will be largely updated from the first version of the website. It is left here as a placeholder page.

The positioning of this book is statistical modelling and inference, applied to building energy performance assessment. In the previous chapter, this approach was presented as a compromise between physical interpretability of parameter estimates, and flexibility of predictive models.

The first step into this approach, before taking data into consideration, is the probabilistic modelling of the energy balance of buildings. Rather than using Building Energy Simulation (BES) software, our approach is generally to start from simple models and gradually increase complexity if required. This means writing each equation individually, and formulating uncertainty into the probabilistic framework.
