    "State-space models (SSM) are the continuous-state equivalent of hidden Markov models: the sequence of $T$ output variables ${y_t}$ is generated by a parallel sequence of $n_x$ latent continuous state variables $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_x}$. Since the letter $x$ is used here to denote the state variable, we denote the explanatory inputs as $u_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_u}$. A Bayesian SSM is fully defined by four distributions: a prior distribution of the parameters $\\theta$; a prior distribution of the first hidden state $\\mathbf{x}_0$; a dynamic model which describes the system dynamics and its uncertainties in terms of the transition probability distribution; a measurement model which describes how the measurements depend on the current state:\n",

    "Filtering, prediction and smoothing are variations of *state estimation*. Filtering and smoothing a linear Gaussian state-space model are respectively done with the Kalman filter (KF) and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother (RTSS). These methods are not applicable to non-linear and non-Gaussian models, but other alternatives are: extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), along with their smoother counterparts (ERTSS and URTSS); sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filters and smoothers; etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter estimation is meant here as the computation of $p(\\theta | \\mathbf{y}_{1:T})$, the marginal posterior of $\\theta$ given all measurements. The way to do this is to perform filtering, which produces the likelihood function $p(\\mathbf{y}_{1:T} | \\theta)$ as a side product. The Maximum Likelihood estimate of $\\theta$ is then obtainable by numerical maximization of the likelihood, otherwise the full posterior density can be approached by one of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. As opposed to batch estimation, on-line estimation means computing $p(\\theta | \\mathbf{y}_{1:t})$ at every time step $t$, i.e. the probability distribution of $\\theta$ given the current and previous measurement.\n",

    "As a practical example of linear state-space models, the simplified resistor-capacitor (RC) model structures are a popular choice for either parameter estimation or system identification.

These models will be used in the next chapter for the estimation of thermal properties of building envelopes.\n",
