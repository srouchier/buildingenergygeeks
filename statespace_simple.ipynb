    "As a practical example of linear state-space models, the simplified resistor-capacitor (RC) model structures are a popular choice for either parameter estimation or system identification. When written as a set of stochastic differential equations, they allow accounting for modelling approximations {cite:p}`madsen1995estimation` and offer a more reproducible parameter estimation than deterministic models that overlook modelling errors {cite:p}`rouchier2018calibration`.\n",

The model will be implemented twice: the first time in a deterministic formulation, without system uncertainty; the second time in a stochastic formulation, solved by the Kalman filter.\n",

    "The experimental test cell used in this study is called the Armadillo Box. It is a demonstration building of 42 m$^2$ floor area, designed for the 2010 European Solar Decathlon by the ENSAG-GAIA-INES team. The envelope is a light wood framed construction with integrated insulation. Heating and cooling is performed by a \"3 in 1\" heat pump, and photovoltaic solar panels provide recharge for electric vehicles."
